          <h4 class="bottomBreak">Conquer Fear - Make a Skydive!</h4>
          <p>You get an awesome view in freefall at Mile-Hi Skydiving Center, only a few miles from the mountains and Colorado's Long's Peak! Mile-Hi Skydiving Center, the only full time, first class skydiving training facility within 100 miles of the Denver
            metro area, and a short 12 mile hop from Boulder and the only skydiving facility to perform over 5000 Tandem Fun jumps a year in Colorado!</p>

          <p>Go along for a jump on a Mile-Hi tandem skydive, the quickest and easiest way to get in the sky! Our fleet of twin engine jet-prop aircraft will elevate you to jump altitude faster than anyone else in the state! Then jump together with your
            nationally licensed tandem instructor from up to 18000' above sea level as you freefall at 130mph. After that intense thrill, you slow down to a quiet, serene ride, flying your parachute, soaring like a glider to landing. With the tandem skydiving
            pilot-passenger freefall system, you can make your first skydive in greater ease and safety than ever before. Your parachute, especially built for two, will carry you and your instructor to a soft landing.</p>

          <h4 class="bottomBreak">What We Recommend</h4>
          <p>The price of $199.00* (click <a href="pricing">here</a> for a full list of prices) includes preflight training and briefing, all equipment, a one way plane ride, approximately one minute of freefall, a five minute parachute ride with a professional
            nationally licensed instructor, and the experience of a lifetime. After you jump, you receive a custom jump certificate and full bragging rights!</p>

          <p>Don't forget a video to remember the experience and show your friends and family! What better way to share your thrill of a lifetime, than with a video of the experience. Our professional freefall videographers are available to shoot video and
            still pictures before, during and after your skydiving experience. Your video is then edited to music and burned on a DVD for you to take with you! What a way to re-live the experience, showing the DVD to your friends and family that night!</p>

          <p>Anyone can participate in this exhilarating sport, even people in their 80's and 90's have enjoyed the thrill of skydiving here at Mile-Hi Skydiving Center! We can also accommodate individuals with physical limitations.</p>

          <h4 class="bottomBreak">Saftey is Our #1 Concern</h4>
          <p>Unfortunately we do have some restrictions. You must 18yrs of age or older and we can only guarantee to take people around 215 lbs in street clothes because of combined weight limits on the gear. We can take people over 215 lbs as long as it
            does not exceed the combined weight limit and with the prior approval of the tandem instructor but the tandem instructors reserve the right to refuse to skydive with any student in the interest of safety.</p>

          <p>Be sure to bring a driver's license, wear tennis shoes, and dress for the conditions of the day. Although we do take walk-ins we do prefer you to make reservations and walk-in customers will get to jump after pre-registered customers make their
            skydives. When calling to make your reservation please have a Visa or MasterCard ready to hold the reservation and we do require a $50.00 deposit with groups larger than ten. We can also be e-mailed at info@milehiskydiving .com and please
            provide your credit card number and expiration, preferred time and date along with first and last names of persons in your party. Cancellations must be made 48hrs in advance. Plan to spend 2 to 4hrs at our skydiving facility to make your skydive.
            We are open year-round for jumping on the weekends and open from Thursday thru Monday during spring and summer time. We are open to schedule your skydive year-round, 7 days a week.</p>

          <p>Also we are the ONLY school in Colorado that uses the most sophisticated safety equipment available on ALL of our parachute equipment.</p>
